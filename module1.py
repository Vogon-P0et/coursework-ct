# Final Challenge: Build a program that asks the user to input their exam score and then prints a message.
# Outputs should be as follows:

# "Excellent" if the score is greater than 90.
# "Good" if the score is between 70 and 90.
# "Needs Improvement" if the score is below 70.

# Display the results.

# Final Challenge: Write a program where the user has to guess a secret number between 1 and 10. The program should provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low and congratulate the user if they guess correctly.
# HINT: Remember that random module we used a few lessons ago? It would be extremely helpful here... 
# Steps:

# Randomly select a secret number between 1-10.
# Ask the user to make a guess between 1-10.
# If the user is correct, print "Congratulations, You guessed the secret number!"
# If the user is too low, print "Too low!"
# If the user is too high, print "Too high!"
# import random
# secret_num = random.randint(1,10)
# guess = int(input("I'd like you to guess a secret number. Please choose a number between 1 and 10\n"))
# if guess == secret_num:
#     print("Congratulations! You guessed the secret number!")
# elif guess > secret_num:
#     print("Too high.")
# elif guess < secret_num:

# Final Challenge: Create a program that asks the user for their top 3 favorite books, stores them in a list, and prints the list in a sorted order.
# Steps:

# Initialize an Empty List.
# Prompt the User for Input.
# Store the Books in the List.
# Sort the List
# Print the Sorted List

# books = []
# fav_1 = input("What are your three favorite books?\n\tPlease type your absolute favorite book:\n")
