     <p>Innvisia brings innovation unlike other agencies. Most marketing agencies have no strategy.<br> They simply try everything strategy, hoping something will work and reporting back to your good or bad. That time can be spent on a focused approach utilizing fewer resources, meaning you pay less. Who would have thought that simply paying attention to your clients, paying attention to detail, and executing thoroughly, making the most impact with the least amount of effort.<br/><br><b><em>Do you really want a separate marketing budget for each of these marketing tools?:</em></b></p>

     <p>At Innvisia, we believe in a much simpler approach...</p>

     <p>A well designed website, built for Conversion Rate Optimization, using Wordpress with premium plugins, or a custom website, fully coded to your specifications will achieve 50-75% of the work needed. The rest is high quality SEO, not with a focus on quick results, but high quality backlinks, well written content, and white hat SEO practices<br/>We don't manage social media, but we can assist with setup, and will provide you with a minimal amount of content. We believe original, organic content makes the biggest impact.<br/>We also don't believe in PPC. Although that may seem against the grain, most agencies can't truly claim a positive ROI on their ad spend. It just becomes a revenue source for the agency, rather than an asset for the client. Email marketing works for certain businesses in certain industries, but that's another effort that can be hit or miss. We believe in being targeted, thorough, and not wasting our time on inefficient methods.</p>
